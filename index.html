            It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a
            hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic
            Empire.
          </p>

          <p>
            During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the
            Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station
            with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home
            aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her
            people and restore freedom to the galaxy.....
